# Intelligent-IDS

Intelligent Intrusion Detection and Threat Mitigation System
Next-Gen Network Security with Explainable AI and Adaptive Feature Engineering

Developed a machine learning-driven intrusion detection system (IDS) achieving 96% binary accuracy and 93% multiclass F1-score on the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

Feature Engineering: Leveraged LightGBM + SHAP for explainable feature selection, prioritizing critical metrics (e.g., packet rate, protocol type) and reducing input dimensions by 35% while retaining 98% predictive power.

Model Architecture:

Built a Bidirectional LSTM with Optuna-optimized hyperparameters for multiclass threat detection (e.g., DoS, exploits, reconnaissance).

Designed a DNN with class-weighted learning for binary anomaly detection, achieving a 0.8% false positive rate.

Class Imbalance: Addressed skewed data using SMOTE oversampling, improving minority-class recall by 25%.

Real-Time Readiness: Optimized models for deployment using TensorFlow SavedModel format and integrated RobustScaler for resilient preprocessing.

Tools & Technologies

ML Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, LightGBM, Scikit-learn.

Feature Engineering: SHAP, Optuna (hyperparameter tuning), SMOTE, RobustScaler.

Deployment: Model serialization (HDF5/ONNX), Flask (API readiness), Jupyter.

Performance Highlights

Trained on 175,341 records from the UNSW-NB15 dataset with 42 features.

Reduced training time by 40% using Optuna for automated hyperparameter optimization.

Achieved <2ms inference latency per sample on a CPU-only environment.
